## Part-Time Employment Analysis

### Project Description

You have been asked to prepare an analysis on part-time employees to brief your Director prior to a meeting with the Workforce Diversity Steering Committee. The goal is to review whether part-time employment arrangements are increasing. The analysis includes:

1. **Trends Over Time in Male and Female Employment:**
   - Analyze trends in male and female part-time employment from 2014 to 2018.
   - Highlight any notable changes in part-time employment during this period.

2. **Current Representation of Part-Time Employees in the Sector and Each Cluster:**
   - Examine the distribution of part-time employees across various clusters.
   - Provide a detailed breakdown of part-time employment within each cluster.

3. **Current Representation of Male and Female Part-Time Employees:**
   - Present the proportion of part-time male and female employees relative to their respective workforces in each cluster and sector-wide.
   - Show changes in these proportions over the last 4 years.

4. **Change in Statistics Over the Last 4 Years:**
   - Evaluate how the representation of male and female part-time employees has changed from 2014 to 2018.
   - Compare the differences and identify significant trends.

5. **Projections for 2025:**
   - Project the future representation of part-time employees by 2025 based on current trends.
   - Include projections for both male and female employees in each cluster and sector-wide.
